# MarcOS-project-bare-metal-code
MarcOS was a project I started in 2001 aiming to create an application using only BIOS interrupt calls.
No dependency to something like MS-DOS or Linux. 

I lost the sources and now I try to reverse engineer my own code 15 years later from a binary image file a created from my test floppy disk.
