	<p> The solution was designed to be shipped on a floppy disk. The Personal Computer
	had to boot on the floppy disk.
	The binary file is an image of a floppy disk.</br>
	You can execute the solution using an hypervisor: VMWare Player was tested.</br>
	You have to remember that the solution expect to be hosted on a floppy disk. So the image has to be
